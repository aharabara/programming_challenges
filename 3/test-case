My fellow Americans, tonight I’m speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.
Every day, Customs and Border Protection agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.
We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.
America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.
It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.
Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans.
Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone.
Ninety percent of which floods across from our southern border.
More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.
In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.
Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.
This is a humanitarian crisis.
A crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul.
Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase.
These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.
One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.
Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.
